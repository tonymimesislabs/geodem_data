## Overall Assessment

4. **Registered Nurse (Aged Care)** (slightly above expected) - Indicates an aging regional population requiring specialized care services

## Most Under-Represented Occupations

1. **Software Engineer** (about a third of expected) - Limited tech industry presence typical of regional centers
2. **ICT Business Analyst** (about a third of expected) - Fewer corporate technology roles outside major cities
3. **Management Consultant** (about half expected) - Less demand for specialized consulting services in regional markets
4. **Marketing Specialist** (about half expected) - Smaller corporate sector reduces demand for specialized marketing roles
5. **Accountant (General)** (about half expected) - Surprising given regional business needs, may indicate consolidation in larger centers

## Summary
Launceston's professional occupation profile reflects its role as a regional service center with strong connections to Tasmania's natural resource industries (forestry, agriculture) and conservation focus. The under-representation of ICT and corporate consulting roles is typical for regional Australia, while the healthcare and education sectors appear well-developed to serve the broader northern Tasmania region.
