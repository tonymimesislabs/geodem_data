# Construction Occupations Analysis: Inner West LGA

## LGA Classification
Inner West is an **urban** LGA, comprising inner-city suburbs of Sydney including areas like Leichhardt, Marrickville, and Balmain. This is a densely populated, gentrified area close to Sydney's CBD.

## Overall Assessment
Construction related occupations show a **mixed representation** in Inner West, with a clear divide between design/planning roles (over-represented) and hands-on trades (under-represented).

## Most Over-Represented Occupations

1. **Architect** (2.4x expected rate, 408 workers) - Highest over-representation
2. **Landscape Architect** (2.1x expected rate, 68 workers) 
3. **Urban and Regional Planner** (1.5x expected rate, 184 workers)
4. **Architects, Designers, Planners and Surveyors nfd** (1.5x expected rate, 128 workers)

**Economic Indication:** This pattern strongly suggests Inner West serves as a hub for construction design and planning professionals, likely reflecting the area's proximity to Sydney CBD, high concentration of educated professionals, and ongoing urban renewal projects. The high representation of landscape architects particularly aligns with the area's focus on urban amenity and heritage conservation.

## Most Under-Represented Occupations

1. **Earthmoving Plant Operators** (various roles at 1/5 expected rate or lower)
2. **Excavator Operator** (1/3 expected rate, 39 workers)
3. **Concreter** (1/2 expected rate, 132 workers)
4. **Carpenter** (1/2 expected rate, 712 workers)
5. **Plumber (General)** (1/2 expected rate, 322 workers)

**Economic Indication:** The under-representation of hands-on trades and heavy machinery operators reflects the urban setting where large-scale earthmoving is limited, and many tradespeople likely commute from more affordable outer suburbs while working on Inner West projects.

## Summary
Inner West's construction occupation profile reveals a knowledge-intensive construction sector focused on design, planning, and project management rather than hands-on trades. This reflects the area's role as a professional services hub and its urban context where renovation and adaptive reuse dominate over new large-scale construction. The LGA appears to house the "brains" of Sydney's construction industry while the "hands" commute in from elsewhere.
